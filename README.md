### CloudRadar Open Source Project
#### Our Goal is to create a free tool (CloudRadar Multi Agent) that helps users have more visibility to their security settings/changes
#### in Cloud Service Providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Rack Space, etc. At the end of the project CloudRadar Agent will:

* Scan and take snapshots of a user's security settings
* Notify the account owner (user) if and when a change or potential security hole is identified via an interface (Phone App, Web Interface)
* Create graphical maps of old vs new security changes to help the user contextualize the effect of the change
* Request an "allow" vs "deny" prompt from the user to either keep the change or have it removed (return to status quo)


CloudRadar will completed using #GOAL# Agent framework (Check out GOAL tutorial: https://goalapl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOAL/overview?mode=global) 

Note: We are making a slight change to how GOAL Agent is generally written. Basically, instead of creating a 'belief.pl' file
from the start, we're letting the EIS (Environment Integration Standard) Java program create the belief file if no initial 
belief.pl file is found, thereby rendering 'initial' beliefs optional.

#### We shall be using the following frameworks/languages for the Agent and it's interface:
     Angular, javascript, and sms/twilio
