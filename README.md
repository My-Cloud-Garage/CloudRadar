### CloudRadar Open Source Project

### Project objective: 
      To create a free tool (CloudRadar Multi Agent) that helps users have extra visibility to their security 
      settings/change in Cloud Service Providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Rack Space, etc. At the end 
      of the project CloudRadar Agent will:
      
           1.  Scan and take snapshots of a user's security settings
           2.  Notify the account owner (user) if and when a change or potential security hole is 
               identified via an interface (Phone App, Web Interface)
           3.  Create graphical maps of old vs new security changes to help the user contextualize the 
               effect of the change
           4.  Request an "allow" vs "deny" prompt from the user to either keep the change or have it 
               removed (return to status quo)



##### Note: CloudRadar will completed using #GOAL# Agent framework (Check out GOAL tutorial: https://goalapl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOAL/overview?mode=global) 


*Note*: We are making a slight change to how GOAL Agent is generally written. Basically, instead of creating a 'belief.pl' file
from the start, we're letting the EIS (Environment Integration Standard) Java program create the belief file if no initial 
belief.pl file is found, thereby rendering 'initial' beliefs optional.


#### We shall be using the following frameworks/languages for the Agent and it's interface:
     Angular, javascript, and sms/twilio
